                  CamlJava - an OCaml/Java interface
                  ==================================

DESCRIPTION:

This is a very preliminary release of CamlJava, an OCaml/Java
interface based on the following schema:

         Caml/C interface       JNI (Java Native Interface)
  Caml <------------------> C <-----------------------------> Java

Currently, CamlJava provides a low-level, weakly-typed OCaml interface 
very similar to the JNI.  Java object references are mapped to an
abstract type, and various JNI-like operations are provided to allow
Java method invocation, field access, and more.  A basic callback
facility (allowing Java code to invoke methods on Caml objects) is
also provided, although some stub Java code must be written by hand.

In the future, a higher-level, strongly-typed interface will be
provided, whereas Java classes are mapped directly to Caml classes.
This raises fairly delicate type mapping issues, though, so don't hold
your breath.


INSTALLATION:

- Edit Makefile.config to define parameters depending on your Java
  installation.  As distributed, the library is set up for
  Sun's JDK version 1.2.2 on a Linux x86 / RedHat 6.2 platform.
  It has never been tested on anything else...

- make
  become superuser
  make install

USAGE:

The module is Jni.  A good knowledge of the JNI is assumed; see Sun's
book or Web pages about JNI.  Then, the comments in lib/jni.mli should
make sense.

Usage:          ocamlc -I +camljava jni.cma ...
            or  ocamlopt -I +camljava jni.cmxa ...

See the programs in test/ for examples of use.
